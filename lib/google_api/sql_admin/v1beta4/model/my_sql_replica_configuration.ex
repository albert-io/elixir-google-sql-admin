  Read-replica configuration specific to MySQL databases.

  ## Attributes

  - caCertificate (String.t): PEM representation of the trusted CA&#39;s x509 certificate. Defaults to: `null`.
  - clientCertificate (String.t): PEM representation of the slave&#39;s x509 certificate. Defaults to: `null`.
  - clientKey (String.t): PEM representation of the slave&#39;s private key. The corresponsing public key is encoded in the client&#39;s certificate. Defaults to: `null`.
  - connectRetryInterval (integer()): Seconds to wait between connect retries. MySQL&#39;s default is 60 seconds. Defaults to: `null`.
  - dumpFilePath (String.t): Path to a SQL dump file in Google Cloud Storage from which the slave instance is to be created. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName. Compressed gzip files (.gz) are also supported. Dumps should have the binlog co-ordinates from which replication should begin. This can be accomplished by setting --master-data to 1 when using mysqldump. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): This is always sql#mysqlReplicaConfiguration. Defaults to: `null`.
  - masterHeartbeatPeriod (String.t): Interval in milliseconds between replication heartbeats. Defaults to: `null`.
  - password (String.t): The password for the replication connection. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslCipher (String.t): A list of permissible ciphers to use for SSL encryption. Defaults to: `null`.
  - username (String.t): The username for the replication connection. Defaults to: `null`.
  - verifyServerCertificate (boolean()): Whether or not to check the master&#39;s Common Name value in the certificate that it sends during the SSL handshake. Defaults to: `null`.
